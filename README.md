						Welcome Electronic TPR Selection Machine
Well I am new to software development and my english also sucks.Sorry for that. Further I am guiding you with some basic instructions to setup
the app and its use.

COMPILING :
   -->On Unix based systems having 'make' utility:
      Just type "make" on terminal and you are ready to use the file "elect.out" in current folder.
   -->Doesn't have make utility:
      just type " g++ elect.cpp functions.cpp graph.cpp term_noecho.cpp -o elect.out "
	  Then you can find elect.out in same folder.Just run this file."
WINDOWS USERS:
	Just run tpr_elect.exe.
	you can also see the source code [elect.cpp graph.cpp functions.cpp functions.h].

DATA SECURITY FEATURE:
  Although the program gives you the final the final value for all conditates, everytime you run it,
  you can check the file data
